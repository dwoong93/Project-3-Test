The Keyboard Shop
This web application will allow visitors to browse through curated custom mechanical keyboard products.
The main motivation for this project came from my past struggles in sourcing for custom mechanical keyboard parts from Chinese seller platforms, as they are often misleading due to insufficient specifications that arise from language barriers. 
The Keyboard shop will provide new custom mechanical keyboard enthusiasts with a fuss-free  solution to building their first keyboard.
